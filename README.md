GitShark is a Git GUI in a similar vein to [Git Fork](https://git-fork.com/), [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/), and others. The big difference? It runs on mobile!

We're currently targeting Android as the initial launch platform, but have long-term goals to port this to iOS as well as desktop OSes such as Windows and MacOS. We're able to do this because we're building on top of React Native, which allows us to more easily port our code.

# Design

While we're not fully finished with implementing the mockups provided to us, this is what the app should look like when finished:

| Name of Screen      | Screenshot                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Repo List           | <img alt="The list of repositories" src="./promo/repositories.png"/> |
| Changes List        | <img alt="The changes screen" src="./promo/changes.png"/>    |
| Commit Page         | <img alt="The commit page" src="./promo/commit.png"/>        |
| Commit History Page | <img alt="The history page" src="./promo/history.png"/>      |


Additionally, we're making great strides to ensure that the UI is polished with animations where appropriate.
